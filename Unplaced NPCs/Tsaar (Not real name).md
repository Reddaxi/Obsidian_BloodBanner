We've got a box that lets us contact him.
He seems willing to trade a wide variety of services for coin. (Including murder, providing various objects etc. etc.)
He's from Oceanstar in Southfold.

Claims:
- He worked with Maurice.

We've run into him a few times:
- When following map on starrite coin, in a hidden cave underneath a platform near the church in [[Redbram]]
- On the road when we went to [[Ã†delhoff Vineyard]]

He has the ability to cast seemingly powerful magic.
When we found him on the road, he created a semi-sentient half horse / half ass out of thin air.
