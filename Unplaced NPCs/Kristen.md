Maybe rat person, maybe halfling.
Has keys to all 4 estates surrounding [[Redbram]].

[[The Party]] sought Kristen out when needing someone who could draw a map of the 4 vinyards ([[Giel Vineyard]], [[Achey Vineyard]], [[Ã†delhoff Vineyard]], [[Deguilliere Vineyard]]) around [[Redbram]].

Kristen revealed to have a set of keys, allowing easy access to all of them.
She was also looking for the killer of [[Raul Lion (Deceased)]], as she had been told to pay them 1 (special?) gold coin by [[Saffira Giel]] 

She is possibly a competent combatant.
Seems to be proficient at sneaking.
