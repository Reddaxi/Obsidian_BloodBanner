From the moment Alexandros was born, he has constantly carried the burden of being born into greatness. While many of his peers envied Alexandros for his, what they perceived to be, luxurious lifestyle, they did not grasp the mountainous, never-ending, all-consuming expectation that came with it. Being related to the all-adored Dragons Bane - saviour of the unscathed, the unburnt - also meant existing in his shadow.

Dear diary,

For my 18th birthday, my father graced us with his presence during swordsmanship's lessons. As usual, he was rather unimpressed with the progress of my brothers and I.
Nicholas, ever eager to please father, challenged the old man to a duel.
After sizing him up, father found my brother's stance and sword grip unacceptable.

I still remember fathers disappointed tone, before he threw my brother to the ground and crushed his arm underneath his boot.
"Your inability never ceases to surprise me." he said.
"Let this be a lesson and be thankful that is only your arm. A dragon had taken more."

Leopold says it'll take weeks before Nicholas can take up training again.

The world see my father as a selfless, world renowned hero. 
To me, he is an unreachable standard, which I am compared to in my every breath.
As a Deguilliere, nothing short of excellence is - or has ever been - accepted.

I cannot wait to join the regiment.
I refuse to stay a faceless background character in the painting of my fathers glory.

As soon as he could lift a sword, he would train under [[Dame Rosaline Briargaard (Gymnastics and Swordsmanship teacher)]] alongside his brothers.

At the age of 18, Alexandros was sent to join the [[The Cardinal Regiment]].
Here, he joins the ranks of [[The 42nd Platoon]].

Opinions of NPC's 

- King Uther
	- I revere the king, but I don't understand how he could let Redbrams level of poverty exist.
- The Man with the White Hair
	- He's a relative of the king, I don't know him personally or how much influence he has.

Redbram NPC's

- Serra des Simone
	- An emotionally driven brat who throws tantrums when things don't go her way. She's passionate, but unreliable. Her words command a lot of respect amongst the common folk (and now the rebellion), due to whose daughter she is, but she cannot be trusted to wield that power.
	- She's also a little cute.
- Mourice des Simone (Renfri only)
- Reeve Roul du Lyon (Renfri only)
- Scratch
	- Never met him. To me, he's the guy that (maybe) delivered the mail I needed to reach my mother to increase her chances of a better life.
- Junk (Queek only)
- Karen Dubois (Queek only)
- Andrew Hoyt (Queen only)
- William NoName (Queek only)
- Kurt NoName
	- ~~My lord and saviour.~~ Kurt Baker is a notable contributor of the rebellion and was a vital part of the Siege of Redbrams barracks. I'll always admire those who dare stand up when the world needs them the most.
