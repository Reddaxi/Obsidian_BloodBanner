From the moment Alexandros was born, he has constantly carried the burden of being born into greatness. While many of his peers envied Alexandros for his, what they perceived to be, luxurious lifestyle, they did not grasp the mountainous, never-ending, all-consuming expectation that came with it. Being related to the all-adored Dragons Bane - saviour of the unscathed, the unburnt - also meant existing in his shadow.

Dear diary,

For my 18th birthday, my father graced us with his presence during swordsmanship's lessons. As usual, he was rather unimpressed with the progress of my brothers and I.
Nicholas, ever eager to please father, challenged the old man to a duel.
After sizing him up, father found my brother's stance and sword grip unacceptable.

I still remember fathers disappointed tone, before he threw my brother to the ground and crushed his arm underneath his boot.
"Your inability never ceases to surprise me." he said.
"Let this be a lesson and be thankful that is only your arm. A dragon had taken more."

Leopold says it'll take weeks before Nicholas can take up training again.

The world see my father as a selfless, world renowned hero. 
To me, he is an unreachable standard, which I am compared to in my every breath.
As a Deguilliere, nothing short of excellence is - or has ever been - accepted.

I cannot wait to join the regiment.
I refuse to stay a faceless background character in the painting of my fathers glory.

As soon as he could lift a sword, he would train under [[Dame Rosaline Briargaard (Gymnastics and Swordsmanship teacher)]] alongside his brothers.

At the age of 18, Alexandros was sent to join the [[The Cardinal Regiment]].
Here, he joins the ranks of [[The 42nd Platoon]].

Opinions of NPC's 

- King Uther
	- I revere the king, but I don't understand how he could let Redbrams level of poverty exist.
- The Man with the White Hair
	- He's a relative of the king, I don't know him personally or how much influence he has.

Redbram NPC's

- Serra des Simone
	- An emotionally driven brat who throws tantrums when things don't go her way. She's passionate, but unreliable. Her words command a lot of respect amongst the common folk (and now the rebellion), due to whose daughter she is, but she cannot be trusted to wield that power. When that is said, I believe Serra does try to do what she thinks is right. I think she does care for the common man. Her heart is one of passion and it is easy to get wrapped up in the amount of emotion she emanates. On a personal level, she's quite intense. Her opinion is often one extreme or the other, which doesn't resonate well with me.
- Mourice des Simone (Renfri only)
- Reeve Roul du Lyon (Renfri only)
- Scratch
	- Never met him. To me, he's the guy that (maybe) delivered the mail I needed to reach my mother to increase her chances of a better life.
- Junk (Queek only)
- Karen Dubois (Queek only)
- Andrew Hoyt (Queen only)
- William NoName (Queek only)
- Kurt NoName
	- ~~My lord and saviour.~~ Kurt Baker is a notable contributor of the rebellion and was a vital part of the Siege of Redbrams barracks. I'll always admire those who dare stand up when the world needs them the most.

The Noble Houses of the Redbram Area

- Aurelius Ædelhoff
	- An old rich man who got caught up in a conspiracy. Aurelius didn't object to us taking his remaining belongings on behalf of the rebellion - But he also didn't really have a choice. So far, he's taken on a sort of "uncle" role in our merry band of collected individuals, offering advice and generally being really relaxed. This suits me well, because I had feared that he'd be very reluctant to travel with us. Our hope is that we can use him when times for negotiations with the king.
- Lady Alicia Achey
	- #bosslady. She took it upon herself to lead a group of armed individuals to route the cowcat from her lands instead of just sending men to do it. I admire nobles who aren't useless. 
- Anastasia Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- My dear mother. She was my source of love and care growing up. I love her with all my heart. Not a single night goes by where I wonder if I've done everything I can to attempt to spare her the fate I fear is soon coming for many nobles.
- Cateline Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
- Constantine Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
- Lance Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
- Cedric Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
