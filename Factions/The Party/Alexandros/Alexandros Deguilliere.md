From the moment Alexandros was born, he has constantly carried the burden of being born into greatness. While many of his peers envied Alexandros for his, what they perceived to be, luxurious lifestyle, they did not grasp the mountainous, never-ending, all-consuming expectation that came with it. Being related to the all-adored Dragons Bane - saviour of the unscathed, the unburnt - also meant existing in his shadow.

Dear diary,

For my 18th birthday, my father graced us with his presence during swordsmanship's lessons. As usual, he was rather unimpressed with the progress of my brothers and I.
Nicholas, ever eager to please father, challenged the old man to a duel.
After sizing him up, father found my brother's stance and sword grip unacceptable.

I still remember fathers disappointed tone, before he threw my brother to the ground and crushed his arm underneath his boot.
"Your inability never ceases to surprise me." he said.
"Let this be a lesson and be thankful that is only your arm. A dragon had taken more."

Leopold says it'll take weeks before Nicholas can take up training again.

The world see my father as a selfless, world renowned hero. 
To me, he is an unreachable standard, which I am compared to in my every breath.
As a Deguilliere, nothing short of excellence is - or has ever been - accepted.

I cannot wait to join the regiment.
I refuse to stay a faceless background character in the painting of my fathers glory.

As soon as he could lift a sword, he would train under [[Dame Rosaline Briargaard (Gymnastics and Swordsmanship teacher)]] alongside his brothers.

At the age of 18, Alexandros was sent to join the [[The Cardinal Regiment]].
Here, he joins the ranks of [[The 42nd Platoon]].

Opinions of NPC's 

- King Uther
	- I revere the king, but I don't understand how he could let Redbrams level of poverty exist.
	- I expect the king to be locked in a military conflict with us for the foreseeable future.
- The Man with the White Hair
	- He's a relative of the king, I don't know him personally or how much influence he has.
	- I assume we'll become adversaries.

Redbram NPC's

- Serra des Simone
	- An emotionally driven brat who throws tantrums when things don't go her way. She's passionate, but unreliable. Her words command a lot of respect amongst the common folk (and now the rebellion), due to whose daughter she is, but she cannot be trusted to wield that power. When that is said, I believe Serra does try to do what she thinks is right. I think she does care for the common man. Her heart is one of passion and it is easy to get wrapped up in the amount of emotion she emanates. On a personal level, she's quite intense. Her opinion is often one extreme or the other, which doesn't resonate well with me.
	- I believe I'll either make up with Serra and we'll return to leading the rebellion together - Or she'll have me killed. I'm positive its a 60/40 situation, but I'm not certain which way.
- Mourice des Simone (Renfri only)
- Reeve Roul du Lyon (Renfri only)
- Scratch
	- Never met him. To me, he's the guy that (maybe) delivered the mail I needed to reach my mother to increase her chances of a better life.
	- I doubt it'll change.
- Junk (Queek only)
- Karen Dubois (Queek only)
- Andrew Hoyt (Queen only)
- William NoName (Queek only)
- Kurt NoName
	- ~~My lord and saviour.~~ Kurt Baker is a notable contributor of the rebellion and was a vital part of the Siege of Redbrams barracks. I'll always admire those who dare stand up when the world needs them the most.
	- I'm sure Kurt's tale has only just begun and I am eager to see what is next in store for him.

The Noble Houses of the Redbram Area

- Aurelius Ædelhoff
	- An old rich man who got caught up in a conspiracy. Aurelius didn't object to us taking his remaining belongings on behalf of the rebellion - But he also didn't really have a choice. So far, he's taken on a sort of "uncle" role in our merry band of collected individuals, offering advice and generally being really relaxed. This suits me well, because I had feared that he'd be very reluctant to travel with us. Our hope is that we can use him when times for negotiations with the king.
	- We're planning to have Aurelius be put in place to add some legitimacy to our claim. I've not fully got him pegged, but within the next few months, I'll find out where he stands, one way or another.
- Lady Alicia Achey
	- #bosslady. She took it upon herself to lead a group of armed individuals to route the cowcat from her lands instead of just sending men to do it. I admire nobles who aren't useless. 
	- I fear what bridges will have to be burned once the rebellion moves east, but I hope the good ones will be accepted. From what I gather, Alicia is one of the good ones.
- Anastasia Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- My dear mother. She was my source of love and care growing up. I love her with all my heart. Not a single night goes by where I wonder if I've done everything I can to attempt to spare her the fate I fear is soon coming for many nobles.
	- I don't expect my relationship to change. I hope to be reunited with her and ensure her safety.
- Cateline Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- My dear little sister. She was but a 6 year old child when I left to join the [[The Cardinal Regiment]]. To her, I'm a distant memory of a brother that once was. To me, she is a beacon of hope that once this era of murder, rebellion and death has passed, her generation might rise up a shape a better world for themselves.
	- I don't expect my relationship to change. I hope to be reunited with her and ensure her safety.
- Constantine Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- Father, o' father of mine. You were my hero. Loved and respected by your peers. Your tale told far and wide. All of that love and respect and you had none to share with us. I do not wish for ill to befall you, but I will do everything I can to prevent you from spreading it.
	- I expect to enter a conflict with my father. Only one of us will leave it alive.
- Lance Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- My sweet little brother. Seeing you well warmed my heart in ways I cannot describe. I hope that once we're done, you will get to forge your own path, instead of being forced into being a pawn in fathers games.
	- I don't expect my relationship to change. I hope to be reunited with him and ensure his safety.
- Cedric Deguilliere (Alexandros only)
	- It feels like yesterday that we played around in the fields, plucking apples from the trees and throwing them at Leopold. I know it is not fair. I know I was the one who left. I know you probably feel deserted to feel the wrath and pressure of father alone. I can only hope your back didn't buckle, that your mind did not falter. My heart would break to see you, having become a shadow of father.
	- I fear having to fight Cedric. I have been away for a long time - And who knows how his mind has been poisoned by father? I just hope that we can reunite once this is all over.

Lange NPC's

- Kirsten de Lange
	- Obviously immensely talented in her field. Her skills, knowledge and connections have benefitted us greatly so far - And her taste in cigars is great! Honestly, I've never been much of a smoker, but wow! I've not felt that relaxed in years. Her skills as a conversationalist aren't something to scuff at either. Honestly, her company is an impossible ray of sunshine on an otherwise dull, grey, overcast afternoon. 
	- It's been awhile since I met anyone that I could just sit down and *talk* to. Not about rebellion or bloodshed or the looming civil war. Just... Normal, mundane things. Being able to 'shoot the shit', dance, play games, win her the hand of the noble Sir. Bearsalot has provided a much needed pause. I wonder what she'll make of the game Tsar showed me? Hmm. I'll have to bring that up next I see her, if I can remember the rules.
	- Do I want the relationship to evolve? I don't know. But it's hard to consider what I wish for the future to hold, when I know I face possible death at multiple turns.
- Gabe de Basile
	- Gabe seems reliable. I think he truly cares for his people, which means his goals align with ours. He'll be a valued ally to our cause and I believe, a good ruler of his people once this is all over.
- Reeve Ruben le Sepent Rouge (Not met)
	- I just hope we can find a peaceful resolution. From what I gather, he's incompetent and is burried in responsibility. Hopefully he'll just peacefully resign and let the rebellion take over.

Other NPC's

- Zar Siwa
	- He shows up suspiciously often. They say three times is a pattern - And I'm still not completely sure what his angle is. I don't think he intends to harm us, but it's hard to believe he keeps showing up simply because he enjoys our company. Even if I must admit he's started growing on me.
	- He's truly a wildcard to me. Who knows what the future holds for us?
- Elven Caravan Leader
	- ~~I think I already commented on [[Serra]]?~~ He seemed to care about his people.
	- Don't really know why or how our relation would change.
- Elven girl
	- I'm just happy we could reunite her with her family.
	- Don't really know why or how our relation would change.
